# üåç World Layoffs Exploratory Data Analysis Project
This project takes a closer look at global layoff trends using real-world data. The dataset covers companies across different industries, countries, and funding stages, giving us a chance to dig into how layoffs have impacted the workforce over time. The dataset used in this project was imported from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/happyude/world-layoffs.

As part of this analysis, I cleaned and prepared the data (handling duplicates, standardizing the data, and handling missing values) and then explored it with SQL to answer questions like: Which industries were hit the hardest? Which companies laid off the most employees? How do layoffs vary by country and over time?

The goal is both to practice solid data cleaning and EDA skills, and to uncover meaningful insights about how layoffs have shaped different parts of the world.

# üõ†Ô∏è Skills Enchanced by this Project:
1. üßπ **Data Cleaning using SQL** - I learned the fundamentals on how to clean a dataset in SQL such as handling duplicates, fixing inconsistencies, and handling missing values. Along the cleaning process, I also discovered different tips and tricks like using subqueries to create a new tables from another table given a set of conditions that enhances the efficiency of the query.
2. üìä **Advanced Querying using SQL for Exploratory Data Analysis** - I have mastered intermediate querying to get results for questions I have in mind. I also had experience creating highly advanced queries to return questions for very specific tasks.

# üîç Insights Gathered
